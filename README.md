# OpenRCT2RideHeightChanger
This is a simple plugin to raise/lower a complete ride by 1 (a ingame height unit is 2 so you can put rides in between two heights).

# Usage
Copy the RideHeight.js file to your OpenRCT2\plugin folder.
In game the menu "Ride Height" will appear, click this.
In the menu which opens select the ride you want to change.
Click the button "Height +1" or "Height -1" to raise/lower the ride.
